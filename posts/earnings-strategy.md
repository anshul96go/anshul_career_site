This blog summarizes my public QuantConnect research into building a trading strategy based **only on price action around earnings dates**.

### ðŸ“Œ Approach:
- Universe: U.S. equities with earnings today
- Entry: Buy if intraday price breaks 1% above open
- Exit: T+2
- Filters: Optional volatility and liquidity screens

```csharp
if (price > open * 1.01 && security.Volatility < 0.02)
{
    SetHoldings(symbol, 0.1);
    ScheduleLiquidation(symbol, Time + TimeSpan.FromDays(2));
}
```
