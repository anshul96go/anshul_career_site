My original BTC quant strategy, while successful, showed large drawdowns. This post covers the **improved version**, where the same signal logic is diversified across BTC and ETH.

### 🔍 Key Results from Diversified Strategy:
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 1.25
- **CAGR**: 50.79%
- **Max Drawdown**: -56.9%
- **Expected Yearly Return**: 79.6%
- **Win Rate (Years)**: 72.73%

This diversification improved both return stability and risk-adjusted metrics.
