This was an experiment testing a simple volatility breakout strategy on BTC and ETH pairs. The logic was to buy when the 5-day high is broken with a volatility filter.

Key takeaways:

- Results were best when using ATR as a volatility filter.
- Mean reversion dominated post-breakout â€” added trailing stops helped.
- Still testing optimal lookbacks and trailing levels.
